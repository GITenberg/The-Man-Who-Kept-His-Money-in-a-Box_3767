<h1>THE MAN WHO KEPT HIS MONEY IN A BOX.</h1>
<p>I <span class="smcap">first</span> saw the man who kept his
money in a box in the midst of the ravine of the Via Mala.&nbsp;
I interchanged a few words with him or with his wife at the
hospice, at the top of the Splugen; and I became acquainted with
him in the courtyard of Conradi&rsquo;s hotel at Chiavenna.&nbsp;
It was, however, afterwards at Bellaggio, on the lake of Como,
that that acquaintance ripened into intimacy.&nbsp; A good many
years have rolled by since then, and I believe this little
episode in his life may be told without pain to the feelings of
any one.</p>
<p>His name was &mdash;; let us for the present say that his name
was Greene.&nbsp; How he learned that my name was Robinson I do
not know, but I remember well that he addressed me by my name at
Chiavenna.&nbsp; To go back, however, for a moment to the Via
Mala;&mdash;I had been staying for a few days at the Golden Eagle
at Tusis,&mdash;which, by-the-bye, I hold to be the best small
inn in all Switzerland, and its hostess to be, or to have been,
certainly the prettiest landlady,&mdash;and on the day of my
departure southwards, I had walked on, into the Via Mala, so that
the diligence might pick me up in the gorge.&nbsp; This pass I
regard as one of the grandest spots to which my wandering steps
have ever carried me, and though I had already lingered about it
for many hours, I now walked thither again to take my last
farewell of its dark towering rocks, its narrow causeway and
roaring river, trusting to my friend the landlady to see that my
luggage was duly packed upon the diligence.&nbsp; I need hardly
say that my friend did not betray her trust.</p>
<p>As one goes out from Switzerland towards Italy, the road
through the Via Mala ascends somewhat steeply, and passengers by
the diligence may walk from the inn at Tusis into the gorge, and
make their way through the greater part of the ravine before the
vehicle will overtake them.&nbsp; This, however, Mr. Greene with
his wife and daughter had omitted to do.&nbsp; When the diligence
passed me in the defile, the horses trotting for a few yards over
some level portion of the road, I saw a man&rsquo;s nose pressed
close against the glass of the coup&eacute; window.&nbsp; I saw
more of his nose than of any other part of his face, but yet I
could perceive that his neck was twisted and his eye upturned,
and that he was making a painful effort to look upwards to the
summit of the rocks from his position inside the carriage.</p>
<p>There was such a roar of wind and waters at the spot that it
was not practicable to speak to him, but I beckoned with my
finger and then pointed to the road, indicating that he should
have walked.&nbsp; He understood me, though I did not at the
moment understand his answering gesture.&nbsp; It was
subsequently, when I knew somewhat of his habits, that he
explained to me that on pointing to his open mouth, he had
intended to signify that he would be afraid of sore throat in
exposing himself to the air of that damp and narrow passage.</p>
<p>I got up into the conductor&rsquo;s covered seat at the back
of the diligence, and in this position encountered the drifting
snow of the Splugen.&nbsp; I think it is coldest of all the
passes.&nbsp; Near the top of the pass the diligence stops for
awhile, and it is here, if I remember, that the Austrian
officials demand the travellers&rsquo; passports.&nbsp; At least
in those days they did so.&nbsp; These officials have now
retreated behind the Quadrilat&egrave;re,&mdash;soon, as we hope,
to make a further retreat,&mdash;and the district belongs to the
kingdom of United Italy.&nbsp; There is a place of refreshment or
hospice here, into which we all went for a few moments, and I
then saw that my friend with the weak throat was accompanied by
two ladies.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You should not have missed the Via Mala,&rdquo; I said
to him, as he stood warming his toes at the huge covered
stove.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We miss everything,&rdquo; said the elder of the two
ladies, who, however, was very much younger than the gentleman,
and not very much older than her companion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it beautifully, mamma,&rdquo; said the younger
one; whereupon mamma gave her head a toss, and made up her mind,
as I thought, to take some little vengeance before long upon her
step-daughter.&nbsp; I observed that Miss Greene always called
her step-mother mamma on the first approach of any stranger, so
that the nature of the connection between them might be
understood.&nbsp; And I observed also that the elder lady always
gave her head a toss when she was so addressed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We don&rsquo;t mean to enjoy ourselves till we get down
to the lake of Como,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene.&nbsp; As I looked at
him cowering over the stove, and saw how oppressed he was with
great coats and warm wrappings for his throat, I quite agreed
with him that he had not begun to enjoy himself as yet.&nbsp;
Then we all got into our places again, and I saw no more of the
Greenes till we were standing huddled together in the large
courtyard of Conradi&rsquo;s hotel at Chiavenna.</p>
<p>Chiavenna is the first Italian town which the tourist reaches
by this route, and I know no town in the North of Italy which is
so closely surrounded by beautiful scenery.&nbsp; The traveller
as he falls down to it from the Splugen road is bewildered by the
loveliness of the valleys,&mdash;that is to say, if he so
arranges that he can see them without pressing his nose against
the glass of a coach window.&nbsp; And then from the town itself
there are walks of two, three, and four hours, which I think are
unsurpassed for wild and sometimes startling beauties.&nbsp; One
gets into little valleys, green as emeralds, and surrounded on
all sides by grey broken rocks, in which Italian Rasselases might
have lived in perfect bliss; and then again one comes upon
distant views up the river courses, bounded far away by the spurs
of the Alps, which are perfect,&mdash;to which the fancy can add
no additional charm.&nbsp; Conradi&rsquo;s hotel also is by no
means bad; or was not in those days.&nbsp; For my part I am
inclined to think that Italian hotels have received a worse name
than they deserve; and I must profess that, looking merely to
creature comforts, I would much sooner stay a week at the Golden
Key at Chiavenna, than with mine host of the King&rsquo;s Head in
the thriving commercial town of Muddleboro, on the borders of
Yorkshire and Lancashire.</p>
<p>I am always rather keen about my room in travelling, and
having secured a chamber looking out upon the mountains, had
returned to the court-yard to collect my baggage before Mr.
Greene had succeeded in realising his position, or understanding
that he had to take upon himself the duties of settling his
family for the night in the hotel by which he was
surrounded.&nbsp; When I descended he was stripping off the
outermost of three great coats, and four waiters around him were
beseeching him to tell them what accommodation he would
require.&nbsp; Mr. Greene was giving sundry very urgent
instructions to the conductor respecting his boxes; but as these
were given in English, I was not surprised to find that they were
not accurately followed.&nbsp; The man, however, was much too
courteous to say in any language that he did not understand every
word that was said to him.&nbsp; Miss Greene was standing apart,
doing nothing.&nbsp; As she was only eighteen years of age, it
was of course her business to do nothing; and a very pretty
little girl she was, by no means ignorant of her own beauty, and
possessed of quite sufficient wit to enable her to make the most
of it.</p>
<p>Mr. Greene was very leisurely in his proceedings, and the four
waiters were almost reduced to despair.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I want two bed-rooms, a dressing-room, and some
dinner,&rdquo; he said at last, speaking very slowly, and in his
own vernacular.&nbsp; I could not in the least assist him by
translating it into Italian, for I did not speak a word of the
language myself; but I suggested that the man would understand
French.&nbsp; The waiter, however, had understood English.&nbsp;
Waiters do understand all languages with a facility that is
marvellous; and this one now suggested that Mrs. Greene should
follow him up-stairs.&nbsp; Mrs. Greene, however, would not move
till she had seen that her boxes were all right; and as Mrs.
Greene was also a pretty woman, I found myself bound to apply
myself to her assistance.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, thank you,&rdquo; said she.&nbsp; &ldquo;The people
are so stupid that one can really do nothing with them.&nbsp; And
as for Mr. Greene, he is of no use at all.&nbsp; You see that
box, the smaller one.&nbsp; I have four hundred pounds&rsquo;
worth of jewellery in that, and therefore I am obliged to look
after it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said I, rather startled at this amount
of confidence on rather a short acquaintance.&nbsp; &ldquo;In
that case I do not wonder at your being careful.&nbsp; But is it
not rather rash, perhaps&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I know what you are going to say.&nbsp; Well, perhaps
it is rash.&nbsp; But when you are going to foreign courts, what
are you to do?&nbsp; If you have got those sort of things you
must wear them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>As I was not myself possessed of anything of that sort, and
had no intention of going to any foreign court, I could not argue
the matter with her.&nbsp; But I assisted her in getting together
an enormous pile of luggage, among which there were seven large
boxes covered with canvas, such as ladies not uncommonly carry
with them when travelling.&nbsp; That one which she represented
as being smaller than the others, and as holding jewellery, might
be about a yard long by a foot and a half deep.&nbsp; Being
ignorant in those matters, I should have thought it sufficient to
carry all a lady&rsquo;s wardrobe for twelve months.&nbsp; When
the boxes were collected together, she sat down upon the
jewel-case and looked up into my face.&nbsp; She was a pretty
woman, perhaps thirty years of age, with long light yellow hair,
which she allowed to escape from her bonnet, knowing, perhaps,
that it was not unbecoming to her when thus dishevelled.&nbsp;
Her skin was very delicate, and her complexion good.&nbsp; Indeed
her face would have been altogether prepossessing had there not
been a want of gentleness in her eyes.&nbsp; Her hands, too, were
soft and small, and on the whole she may be said to have been
possessed of a strong battery of feminine attractions.&nbsp; She
also well knew how to use them.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Whisper,&rdquo; she said to me, with a peculiar but
very proper aspiration on the h&mdash;&ldquo;Wh-hisper,&rdquo;
and both by the aspiration and the use of the word I knew at once
from what island she had come.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Greene keeps all
his money in this box also; so I never let it go out of my sight
for a moment.&nbsp; But whatever you do, don&rsquo;t tell him
that I told you so.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I laid my hand on my heart, and made a solemn asseveration
that I would not divulge her secret.&nbsp; I need not, however,
have troubled myself much on that head, for as I walked up
stairs, keeping my eye upon the precious trunk, Mr. Greene
addressed me.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are an Englishman, Mr. Robinson,&rdquo; said
he.&nbsp; I acknowledged that I was.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am another.&nbsp; My wife, however, is Irish.&nbsp;
My daughter,&mdash;by a former marriage,&mdash;is English
also.&nbsp; You see that box there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;I see it.&rdquo;&nbsp; I
began to be so fascinated by the box that I could not keep my
eyes off it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether or no it is prudent, but I
keep all my money there; my money for travelling, I
mean.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;If I were you, then,&rdquo; I answered, &ldquo;I would
not say anything about it to any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, of course not,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;I should
not think of mentioning it.&nbsp; But those brigands in Italy
always take away what you have about your person, but they
don&rsquo;t meddle with the heavy luggage.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Bills of exchange, or circular notes,&rdquo; I
suggested.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ah, yes; and if you can&rsquo;t identify yourself, or
happen to have a headache, you can&rsquo;t get them
changed.&nbsp; I asked an old friend of mine, who has been
connected with the Bank of England for the last fifty years, and
he assured me that there was nothing like sovereigns.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you never get the value for them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite.&nbsp; One loses a franc, or a franc
and a half.&nbsp; But still, there&rsquo;s the certainty, and
that&rsquo;s the great matter.&nbsp; An English sovereign will go
anywhere,&rdquo; and he spoke these words with considerable
triumph.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly, if you consent to lose a shilling on each
sovereign.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;At any rate, I have got three hundred and fifty in that
box,&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have them done up in rolls of
twenty-five pounds each.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I again recommended him to keep this arrangement of his as
private as possible,&mdash;a piece of counsel which I confess
seemed to me to be much needed,&mdash;and then I went away to my
own room, having first accepted an invitation from Mrs. Greene to
join their party at dinner.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do,&rdquo; said she;
&ldquo;we have been so dull, and it will be so
pleasant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I did not require to be much pressed to join myself to a party
in which there was so pretty a girl as Miss Greene, and so
attractive a woman as Mrs. Greene.&nbsp; I therefore accepted the
invitation readily, and went away to make my toilet.&nbsp; As I
did so I passed the door of Mr. Greene&rsquo;s room, and saw the
long file of boxes being borne into the centre of it.</p>
<p>I spent a pleasant evening, with, however, one or two slight
drawbacks.&nbsp; As to old Greene himself, he was all that was
amiable; but then he was nervous, full of cares, and somewhat apt
to be a bore.&nbsp; He wanted information on a thousand points,
and did not seem to understand that a young man might prefer the
conversation of his daughter to his own.&nbsp; Not that he showed
any solicitude to prevent conversation on the part of his
daughter.&nbsp; I should have been perfectly at liberty to talk
to either of the ladies had he not wished to engross all my
attention to himself.&nbsp; He also had found it dull to be alone
with his wife and daughter for the last six weeks.</p>
<p>He was a small spare man, probably over fifty years of age,
who gave me to understand that he had lived in London all his
life, and had made his own fortune in the city.&nbsp; What he had
done in the city to make his fortune he did not say.&nbsp; Had I
come across him there I should no doubt have found him to be a
sharp man of business, quite competent to teach me many a useful
lesson of which I was as ignorant as an infant.&nbsp; Had he
caught me on the Exchange, or at Lloyd&rsquo;s, or in the big
room of the Bank of England, I should have been compelled to ask
him everything.&nbsp; Now, in this little town under the Alps, he
was as much lost as I should have been in Lombard Street, and was
ready enough to look to me for information.&nbsp; I was by no
means chary in giving him my counsel, and imparting to him my
ideas on things in general in that part of the world;&mdash;only
I should have preferred to be allowed to make myself civil to his
daughter.</p>
<p>In the course of conversation it was mentioned by him that
they intended to stay a few days at Bellaggio, which, as all the
world knows, is a central spot on the lake of Como, and a
favourite resting-place for travellers.&nbsp; There are three
lakes which all meet here, and to all of which we give the name
of Como.&nbsp; They are properly called the lakes of Como,
Colico, and Lecco; and Bellaggio is the spot at which their
waters join each other.&nbsp; I had half made up my mind to sleep
there one night on my road into Italy, and now, on hearing their
purpose, I declared that such was my intention.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How very pleasant,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.&nbsp;
&ldquo;It will be quite delightful to have some one to show us
how to settle ourselves, for really&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear, I&rsquo;m sure you can&rsquo;t say that you
ever have much trouble.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And who does then, Mr. Greene?&nbsp; I am sure
Sophonisba does not do much to help me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t let me,&rdquo; said Sophonisba, whose
name I had not before heard.&nbsp; Her papa had called her Sophy
in the yard of the inn.&nbsp; Sophonisba Greene!&nbsp; Sophonisba
Robinson did not sound so badly in my ears, and I confess that I
had tried the names together.&nbsp; Her papa had mentioned to me
that he had no other child, and had mentioned also that he had
made his fortune.</p>
<p>And then there was a little family contest as to the amount of
travelling labour which fell to the lot of each of the party,
during which I retired to one of the windows of the big front
room in which we were sitting.&nbsp; And how much of this labour
there is incidental to a tourist&rsquo;s pursuits!&nbsp; And how
often these little contests do arise upon a journey!&nbsp; Who
has ever travelled and not known them?&nbsp; I had taken up such
a position at the window as might, I thought, have removed me out
of hearing; but nevertheless from time to time a word would catch
my ear about that precious box.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have never taken
<i>my</i> eyes off it since I left England,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene, speaking quick, and with a considerable brogue
superinduced by her energy.&nbsp; &ldquo;Where would it have been
at Basle if I had not been looking after it?&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Quite safe,&rdquo; said Sophonisba; &ldquo;those large
things always are safe.&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;Are they, Miss?&nbsp;
That&rsquo;s all you know about it.&nbsp; I suppose your
bonnet-box was quite safe when I found it on the platform
at&mdash;at&mdash;I forget the name of the place?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Freidrichshafen,&rdquo; said Sophonisba, with almost an
unnecessary amount of Teutonic skill in her pronunciation.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Well, mamma, you have told me of that at least twenty
times.&rdquo;&nbsp; Soon after that, the ladies took them to
their own rooms, weary with the travelling of two days and a
night, and Mr. Greene went fast asleep in the very comfortless
chair in which he was seated.</p>
<p>At four o&rsquo;clock on the next morning we started on our
journey.</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Early to bed, and early to rise,<br />
Is the way to be healthy, and wealthy, and wise.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We all know that lesson, and many of us believe in it; but if
the lesson be true, the Italians ought to be the healthiest and
wealthiest and wisest of all men and women.&nbsp; Three or four
o&rsquo;clock seems to them quite a natural hour for commencing
the day&rsquo;s work.&nbsp; Why we should have started from
Chiavenna at four o&rsquo;clock in order that we might be kept
waiting for the boat an hour and a half on the little quay at
Colico, I don&rsquo;t know; but such was our destiny.&nbsp; There
we remained an hour and a half; Mrs. Greene sitting
pertinaciously on the one important box.&nbsp; She had designated
it as being smaller than the others, and, as all the seven were
now ranged in a row, I had an opportunity of comparing
them.&nbsp; It was something smaller,&mdash;perhaps an inch less
high, and an inch and a half shorter.&nbsp; She was a sharp
woman, and observed my scrutiny.&nbsp; &ldquo;I always know
it,&rdquo; she said in a loud whisper, &ldquo;by this little hole
in the canvas,&rdquo; and she put her finger on a slight rent on
one of the ends.&nbsp; &ldquo;As for Greene, if one of those
Italian brigands were to walk off with it on his shoulders,
before his eyes, he wouldn&rsquo;t be the wiser.&nbsp; How
helpless you men are, Mr. Robinson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is well for us that we have women to look after
us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But you have got no one to look after you;&mdash;or
perhaps you have left her behind?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;No, indeed.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m all alone in the world as
yet.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s not my own fault.&nbsp; I have asked
half a dozen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Now, Mr. Robinson!&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this way the
time passed on the quay at Colico, till the boat came and took us
away.&nbsp; I should have preferred to pass my time in making
myself agreeable to the younger lady; but the younger lady stood
aloof, turning up her nose, as I thought, at her mamma.</p>
<p>I will not attempt to describe the scenery about Colico.&nbsp;
The little town itself is one of the vilest places under the sun,
having no accommodation for travellers, and being excessively
unhealthy; but there is very little either north or south of the
Alps,&mdash;and, perhaps, I may add, very little
elsewhere,&mdash;to beat the beauty of the mountains which
cluster round the head of the lake.&nbsp; When we had sat upon
those boxes that hour and a half, we were taken on board the
steamer, which had been lying off a little way from the shore,
and then we commenced our journey.&nbsp; Of course there was a
good deal of exertion and care necessary in getting the packages
off from the shore on to the boat, and I observed that any one
with half an eye in his head might have seen that the mental
anxiety expended on that one box which was marked by the small
hole in the canvas far exceeded that which was extended to all
the other six boxes.&nbsp; &ldquo;They deserve that it should be
stolen,&rdquo; I said to myself, &ldquo;for being such
fools.&rdquo;&nbsp; And then we went down to breakfast in the
cabin.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose it must be safe,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene to
me, ignoring the fact that the cabin waiter understood English,
although she had just ordered some veal cutlets in that
language.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As safe as a church,&rdquo; I replied, not wishing to
give much apparent importance to the subject.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They can&rsquo;t carry it off here,&rdquo; said Mr.
Greene.&nbsp; But he was innocent of any attempt at a joke, and
was looking at me with all his eyes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;They might throw it overboard,&rdquo; said
Sophonisba.&nbsp; I at once made up my mind that she could not be
a good-natured girl.&nbsp; The moment that breakfast was over,
Mrs. Greene returned again up-stairs, and I found her seated on
one of the benches near the funnel, from which she could keep her
eyes fixed upon the box.&nbsp; &ldquo;When one is obliged to
carry about one&rsquo;s jewels with one, one must be careful, Mr.
Robinson,&rdquo; she said to me apologetically.&nbsp; But I was
becoming tired of the box, and the funnel was hot and unpleasant,
therefore I left her.</p>
<p>I had made up my mind that Sophonisba was ill-natured; but,
nevertheless, she was pretty, and I now went through some little
man&oelig;uvres with the object of getting into conversation with
her.&nbsp; This I soon did, and was surprised by her
frankness.&nbsp; &ldquo;How tired you must be of mamma and her
box,&rdquo; she said to me.&nbsp; To this I made some answer,
declaring that I was rather interested than otherwise in the
safety of the precious trunk.&nbsp; &ldquo;It makes me
sick,&rdquo; said Sophonisba, &ldquo;to hear her go on in that
way to a perfect stranger.&nbsp; I heard what she said about her
jewellery.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is natural she should be anxious,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;seeing that it contains so much that is
valuable.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did she bring them?&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp;
&ldquo;She managed to live very well without jewels till papa
married her, about a year since; and now she can&rsquo;t travel
about for a month without lugging them with her everywhere.&nbsp;
I should be so glad if some one would steal them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But all Mr. Greene&rsquo;s money is there
also.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want papa to be bothered, but I declare I
wish the box might be lost for a day or so.&nbsp; She is such a
fool; don&rsquo;t you think so, Mr. Robinson?&rdquo;</p>
<p>At this time it was just fourteen hours since I first had made
their acquaintance in the yard of Conradi&rsquo;s hotel, and of
those fourteen hours more than half had been passed in bed.&nbsp;
I must confess that I looked upon Sophonisba as being almost more
indiscreet than her mother-in-law.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she was
not stupid, and I continued my conversation with her the greatest
part of the way down the lake towards Bellaggio.</p>
<p>These steamers which run up and down the lake of Como and the
Lago Maggiore, put out their passengers at the towns on the banks
of the water by means of small rowing-boats, and the persons who
are about to disembark generally have their own articles ready to
their hands when their turn comes for leaving the steamer.&nbsp;
As we came near to Bellaggio, I looked up my own portmanteau,
and, pointing to the beautiful wood-covered hill that stands at
the fork of the waters, told my friend Greene that he was near
his destination.&nbsp; &ldquo;I am very glad to hear it,&rdquo;
said he, complacently, but he did not at the moment busy himself
about the boxes.&nbsp; Then the small boat ran up alongside the
steamer, and the passengers for Como and Milan crowded up the
side.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We have to go in that boat,&rdquo; I said to
Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense!&rdquo; he exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, but we have.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;What! put our boxes into that boat,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene.&nbsp; &ldquo;Oh dear!&nbsp; Here, boatman! there are
seven of these boxes, all in white like this,&rdquo; and she
pointed to the one that had the hole in the canvas.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Make haste.&nbsp; And there are two bags, and my dressing
case, and Mr. Greene&rsquo;s portmanteau.&nbsp; Mr. Greene, where
is your portmanteau?&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boatman whom she addressed, no doubt did not understand a
word of English, but nevertheless he knew what she meant, and,
being well accustomed to the work, got all the luggage together
in an incredibly small number of moments.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will get down into the boat,&rdquo; I said,
&ldquo;I will see that the luggage follows you before I leave the
deck.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t stir,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;till I see
that box lifted down.&nbsp; Take care; you&rsquo;ll let it fall
into the lake.&nbsp; I know you will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wish they would,&rdquo; Sophonisba whispered into my
ear.</p>
<p>Mr. Greene said nothing, but I could see that his eyes were as
anxiously fixed on what was going on as were those of his
wife.&nbsp; At last, however, the three Greens were in the boat,
as also were all the packages.&nbsp; Then I followed them, my
portmanteau having gone down before me, and we pushed off for
Bellaggio.&nbsp; Up to this period most of the attendants around
us had understood a word or two of English, but now it would be
well if we could find some one to whose ears French would not be
unfamiliar.&nbsp; As regarded Mr. Greene and his wife, they, I
found, must give up all conversation, as they knew nothing of any
language but their own.&nbsp; Sophonisba could make herself
understood in French, and was quite at home, as she assured me,
in German.&nbsp; And then the boat was beached on the shore at
Bellaggio, and we all had to go again to work with the object of
getting ourselves lodged at the hotel which overlooks the
water.</p>
<p>I had learned before that the Greenes were quite free from any
trouble in this respect, for their rooms had been taken for them
before they left England.&nbsp; Trusting to this, Mrs. Greene
gave herself no inconsiderable airs the moment her foot was on
the shore, and ordered the people about as though she were the
Lady Paramount of Bellaggio.&nbsp; Italians, however, are used to
this from travellers of a certain description.&nbsp; They never
resent such conduct, but simply put it down in the bill with the
other articles.&nbsp; Mrs. Greene&rsquo;s words on this occasion
were innocent enough, seeing that they were English; but had I
been that head waiter who came down to the beach with his nice
black shiny hair, and his napkin under his arm, I should have
thought her manner very insolent.</p>
<p>Indeed, as it was, I did think so, and was inclined to be
angry with her.&nbsp; She was to remain for some time at
Bellaggio, and therefore it behoved her, as she thought, to
assume the character of the grand lady at once.&nbsp; Hitherto
she had been willing enough to do the work, but now she began to
order about Mr. Greene and Sophonisba; and, as it appeared to me,
to order me about also.&nbsp; I did not quite enjoy this; so
leaving her still among her luggage and satellites, I walked up
to the hotel to see about my own bed-room.&nbsp; I had some
seltzer water, stood at the window for three or four minutes, and
then walked up and down the room.&nbsp; But still the Greenes
were not there.&nbsp; As I had put in at Bellaggio solely with
the object of seeing something more of Sophonisba, it would not
do for me to quarrel with them, or to allow them so to settle
themselves in their private sitting-room, that I should be
excluded.&nbsp; Therefore I returned again to the road by which
they must come up, and met the procession near the house.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene was leading it with great majesty, the waiter with
the shiny hair walking by her side to point out to her the
way.&nbsp; Then came all the luggage,&mdash;each porter carrying
a white canvas-covered box.&nbsp; That which was so valuable no
doubt was carried next to Mrs. Greene, so that she might at a
moment&rsquo;s notice put her eye upon the well-known valuable
rent.&nbsp; I confess that I did not observe the hole as the
train passed by me, nor did I count the number of the
boxes.&nbsp; Seven boxes, all alike, are very many; and then they
were followed by three other men with the inferior
articles,&mdash;Mr. Greene&rsquo;s portmanteau, the carpetbag,
&amp;e., &amp;c.&nbsp; At the tail of the line, I found Mr.
Greene, and behind him Sophonisba.&nbsp; &ldquo;All your fatigues
will be over now,&rdquo; I said to the gentleman, thinking it
well not to be too particular in my attentions to his
daughter.&nbsp; He was panting beneath a terrible great-coat,
having forgotten that the shores of an Italian lake are not so
cold as the summits of the Alps, and did not answer me.&nbsp;
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure I hope so,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp;
&ldquo;And I shall advise papa not to go any farther unless he
can persuade Mrs. Greene to send her jewels home.&rdquo;&nbsp;
&ldquo;Sophy, my dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;for Heaven&rsquo;s
sake let us have a little peace since we are here.&rdquo;&nbsp;
From all which I gathered that Mr. Green had not been fortunate
in his second matrimonial adventure.&nbsp; We then made our way
slowly up to the hotel, having been altogether distanced by the
porters, and when we reached the house we found that the
different packages were already being carried away through the
house, some this way and some that.&nbsp; Mrs. Green, the
meanwhile, was talking loudly at the door of her own
sitting-room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greene,&rdquo; she said, as soon as she saw her
heavily oppressed spouse,&mdash;for the noonday sun was
up,&mdash;&ldquo;Mr. Greene, where are you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Here, my dear,&rdquo; and Mr. Greene threw himself
panting into the corner of a sofa.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A little seltzer water and brandy,&rdquo; I
suggested.&nbsp; Mr. Greene&rsquo;s inmost heart leaped at the
hint, and nothing that his remonstrant wife could say would
induce him to move, until he had enjoyed the delicious
draught.&nbsp; In the mean time the box with the hole in the
canvas had been lost.</p>
<p>Yes; when we came to look into matters, to count the packages,
and to find out where we were, the box with the hole in the
canvas was not there.&nbsp; Or, at any rate, Mrs. Greene said it
was not there.&nbsp; I worked hard to look it up, and even went
into Sophonisba&rsquo;s bed-room in my search.&nbsp; In
Sophonisba&rsquo;s bed-room there was but one canvas-covered
box.&nbsp; &ldquo;That is my own,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;and it
is all that I have, except this bag.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Where on earth can it be?&rdquo; said I, sitting down
on the trunk in question.&nbsp; At the moment I almost thought
that she had been instrumental in hiding it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;How am I to know?&rdquo; she answered; and I fancied
that even she was dismayed.&nbsp; &ldquo;What a fool that woman
is!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The box must be in the house,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do find it, for papa&rsquo;s sake; there&rsquo;s a good
fellow.&nbsp; He will be so wretched without his money.&nbsp; I
heard him say that he had only two pounds in his
purse.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, I can let him have money to go on with,&rdquo; I
answered grandly.&nbsp; And then I went off to prove that I was a
good fellow, and searched throughout the house.&nbsp; Two white
boxes had by order been left downstairs, as they would not be
needed; and these two were in a large cupboard of the hall, which
was used expressly for stowing away luggage.&nbsp; And then there
were three in Mrs. Greene&rsquo;s bed-room, which had been taken
there as containing the wardrobe which she would require while
remaining at Bellaggio.&nbsp; I searched every one of these
myself to see if I could find the hole in the canvas.&nbsp; But
the hole in the canvas was not there.&nbsp; And let me count as I
would, I could make out only six.&nbsp; Now there certainly had
been seven on board the steamer, though I could not swear that I
had seen the seven put into the small boat.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Greene,&rdquo; said the lady standing in the middle
of her remaining treasures, all of which were now open,
&ldquo;you are worth nothing when travelling.&nbsp; Were you not
behind?&rdquo;&nbsp; But Mr. Greene&rsquo;s mind was full, and he
did not answer.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It has been stolen before your very eyes,&rdquo; she
continued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense, mamma,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp;
&ldquo;If ever it came out of the steamer it certainly came into
the house.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I saw it out of the steamer,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene,
&ldquo;and it certainly is not in the house.&nbsp; Mr. Robinson,
may I trouble you to send for the police?&mdash;at once, if you
please, sir.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I had been at Bellaggio twice before, but nevertheless I was
ignorant of their system of police.&nbsp; And then, again, I did
not know what was the Italian for the word.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I will speak to the landlord,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If you will have the goodness to send for the police at
once, I will be obliged to you.&rdquo;&nbsp; And as she thus
reiterated her command, she stamped with her foot upon the
floor.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are no police at Bellaggio,&rdquo; said
Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What on earth shall I do for money to go on
with?&rdquo; said Mr. Greene, looking piteously up to the
ceiling, and shaking both his hands.</p>
<p>And now the whole house was in an uproar, including not only
the landlord, his wife and daughters, and all the servants, but
also every other visitor at the hotel.&nbsp; Mrs. Greene was not
a lady who hid either her glories or her griefs under a bushel,
and, though she spoke only in English, she soon made her
protestations sufficiently audible.&nbsp; She protested loudly
that she had been robbed, and that she had been robbed since she
left the steamer.&nbsp; The box had come on shore; of that she
was quite certain.&nbsp; If the landlord had any regard either
for his own character or for that of his house, he would
ascertain before an hour was over where it was, and who had been
the thief.&nbsp; She would give him an hour.&nbsp; And then she
sat herself down; but in two minutes she was up again,
vociferating her wrongs as loudly as ever.&nbsp; All this was
filtered through me and Sophonisba to the waiter in French, and
from the waiter to the landlord; but the lady&rsquo;s gestures
required no translation to make them intelligible, and the state
of her mind on the matter was, I believe, perfectly well
understood.</p>
<p>Mr. Greene I really did pity.&nbsp; His feelings of dismay
seemed to be quite as deep, but his sorrow and solicitude were
repressed into more decorum.&nbsp; &ldquo;What am I to do for
money?&rdquo; he said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I have not a shilling to go
on with!&rdquo;&nbsp; And he still looked up at the ceiling.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You must send to England,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will take a month,&rdquo; he replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robinson will let you have what you want at
present,&rdquo; added Sophonisba.&nbsp; Now I certainly had said
so, and had meant it at the time.&nbsp; But my whole travelling
store did not exceed forty or fifty pounds, with which I was
going on to Venice, and then back to England through the
Tyrol.&nbsp; Waiting a month for Mr. Greene&rsquo;s money from
England might be even more inconvenient to me than to him.&nbsp;
Then it occurred to me that the wants of the Greene family would
be numerous and expensive, and that my small stock would go but a
little way among so many.&nbsp; And what also if there had been
no money and no jewels in that accursed box!&nbsp; I confess that
at the moment such an idea did strike my mind.&nbsp; One hears of
sharpers on every side committing depredations by means of most
singular intrigues and contrivances.&nbsp; Might it not be
possible that the whole batch of Greenes belonged to this order
of society.&nbsp; It was a base idea, I own; but I confess that I
entertained it for a moment.</p>
<p>I retired to my own room for a while that I might think over
all the circumstances.&nbsp; There certainly had been seven
boxes, and one had had a hole in the canvas.&nbsp; All the seven
had certainly been on board the steamer.&nbsp; To so much I felt
that I might safely swear.&nbsp; I had not counted the seven into
the small boat, but on leaving the larger vessel I had looked
about the deck to see that none of the Greene trappings were
forgotten.&nbsp; If left on the steamer, it had been so left
through an intent on the part of some one there employed.&nbsp;
It was quite possible that the contents of the box had been
ascertained through the imprudence of Mrs. Greene, and that it
had been conveyed away so that it might be rifled at Como.&nbsp;
As to Mrs. Greene&rsquo;s assertion that all the boxes had been
put into the small boat, I thought nothing of it.&nbsp; The
people at Bellaggio could not have known which box to steal, nor
had there been time to concoct the plan in carrying the boxes up
to the hotel.&nbsp; I came at last to this conclusion, that the
missing trunk had either been purloined and carried on to
Como,&mdash;in which case it would be necessary to lose no time
in going after it; or that it had been put out of sight in some
uncommonly clever way, by the Greenes themselves, as an excuse
for borrowing as much money as they could raise and living
without payment of their bills.&nbsp; With reference to the
latter hypothesis, I declared to myself that Greene did not look
like a swindler; but as to Mrs. Greene&mdash;!&nbsp; I confess
that I did not feel so confident in regard to her.</p>
<p>Charity begins at home, so I proceeded to make myself
comfortable in my room, feeling almost certain that I should not
be able to leave Bellaggio on the following morning.&nbsp; I had
opened my portmanteau when I first arrived, leaving it open on
the floor as is my wont.&nbsp; Some people are always being
robbed, and are always locking up everything; while others wander
safe over the world and never lock up anything.&nbsp; For myself,
I never turn a key anywhere, and no one ever purloins from me
even a handkerchief.&nbsp; Cantabit vacuus&mdash;, and I am
always sufficiently vacuus.&nbsp; Perhaps it is that I have not a
handkerchief worth the stealing.&nbsp; It is your heavy-laden,
suspicious, mal-adroit Greenes that the thieves attack.&nbsp; I
now found out that the accommodating Boots, who already knew my
ways, had taken my travelling gear into a dark recess which was
intended to do for a dressing-room, and had there spread my
portmanteau open upon some table or stool in the corner.&nbsp; It
was a convenient arrangement, and there I left it during the
whole period of my sojourn.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene had given the landlord an hour to find the box,
and during that time the landlord, the landlady, their three
daughters, and all the servants in the house certainly did exert
themselves to the utmost.&nbsp; Half a dozen times they came to
my door, but I was luxuriating in a washing-tub, making up for
that four-o&rsquo;clock start from Chiavenna.&nbsp; I assured
them, however, that the box was not there, and so the search
passed by.&nbsp; At the end of the hour I went back to the
Greenes according to promise, having resolved that some one must
be sent on to Como to look after the missing article.</p>
<p>There was no necessity to knock at their sitting-room door,
for it was wide open.&nbsp; I walked in, and found Mrs. Greene
still engaged in attacking the landlord, while all the porters
who had carried the luggage up to the house were standing
round.&nbsp; Her voice was loud above the others, but, luckily
for them all, she was speaking English.&nbsp; The landlord, I
saw, was becoming sulky.&nbsp; He spoke in Italian, and we none
of us understood him, but I gathered that he was declining to do
anything further.&nbsp; The box, he was certain, had never come
out of the steamer.&nbsp; The Boots stood by interpreting into
French, and, acting as second interpreter, I put it into
English.</p>
<p>Mr. Greene, who was seated on the sofa, groaned audibly, but
said nothing.&nbsp; Sophonisba, who was sitting by him, beat upon
the floor with both her feet.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you hear, Mr. Greene?&rdquo; said she, turning to
him.&nbsp; &ldquo;Do you mean to allow that vast amount of
property to be lost without an effort?&nbsp; Are you prepared to
replace my jewels?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Her jewels!&rdquo; said Sophonisba, looking up into my
face.&nbsp; &ldquo;Papa had to pay the bill for every stitch she
had when he married her.&rdquo;&nbsp; These last words were so
spoken as to be audible only by me, but her first exclamation was
loud enough.&nbsp; Were they people for whom it would be worth my
while to delay my journey, and put myself to serious
inconvenience with reference to money?</p>
<p>A few minutes afterwards I found myself with Greene on the
terrace before the house.&nbsp; &ldquo;What ought I to do?&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go to Como,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;and look after your
box.&nbsp; I will remain here and go on board the return
steamer.&nbsp; It may perhaps be there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t speak a word of Italian,&rdquo; said
he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Take the Boots,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I can&rsquo;t speak a word of French.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then it ended in my undertaking to go to Como.&nbsp; I swear
that the thought struck me that I might as well take my
portmanteau with me, and cut and run when I got there.&nbsp; The
Greenes were nothing to me.</p>
<p>I did not, however, do this.&nbsp; I made the poor man a
promise, and I kept it.&nbsp; I took merely a dressing-bag, for I
knew that I must sleep at Como; and, thus resolving to disarrange
all my plans, I started.&nbsp; I was in the midst of beautiful
scenery, but I found it quite impossible to draw any enjoyment
from it;&mdash;from that or from anything around me.&nbsp; My
whole mind was given up to anathemas against this odious box, as
to which I had undoubtedly heavy cause of complaint.&nbsp; What
was the box to me?&nbsp; I went to Como by the afternoon steamer,
and spent a long dreary evening down on the steamboat quays
searching everywhere, and searching in vain.&nbsp; The boat by
which we had left Colico had gone back to Colico, but the people
swore that nothing had been left on board it.&nbsp; It was just
possible that such a box might have gone on to Milan with the
luggage of other passengers.</p>
<p>I slept at Como, and on the following morning I went on to
Milan.&nbsp; There was no trace of the box to be found in that
city.&nbsp; I went round to every hotel and travelling office,
but could hear nothing of it.&nbsp; Parties had gone to Venice,
and Florence, and Bologna, and any of them might have taken the
box.&nbsp; No one, however, remembered it; and I returned back to
Como, and thence to Bellaggio, reaching the latter place at nine
in the evening, disappointed, weary, and cross.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Has Monsieur found the accursed trunk?&rdquo; said the
Bellaggio Boots, meeting me on the quay.</p>
<p>&ldquo;In the name of the&mdash;, no.&nbsp; Has it not turned
up here?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Boots, &ldquo;we shall all be
mad soon.&nbsp; The poor master, he is mad already.&rdquo;&nbsp;
And then I went up to the house.</p>
<p>&ldquo;My jewels!&rdquo; shouted Mrs. Greene, rushing to me
with her arms stretched out as soon as she heard my step in the
corridor.&nbsp; I am sure that she would have embraced me had I
found the box.&nbsp; I had not, however, earned any such
reward.&nbsp; &ldquo;I can hear nothing of the box either at Como
or Milan,&rdquo; I said.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Then what on earth am I to do for my money?&rdquo; said
Mr. Greene.</p>
<p>I had had neither dinner nor supper, but the elder Greenes did
not care for that.&nbsp; Mr. Greene sat silent in despair, and
Mrs. Greene stormed about the room in her anger.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
am afraid you are very tired,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I am tired, and hungry, and thirsty,&rdquo; said
I.&nbsp; I was beginning to get angry, and to think myself ill
used.&nbsp; And that idea as to a family of swindlers became
strong again.&nbsp; Greene had borrowed ten napoleons from me
before I started for Como, and I had spent above four in my
fruitless journey to that place and Milan.&nbsp; I was beginning
to fear that my whole purpose as to Venice and the Tyrol would be
destroyed; and I had promised to meet friends at Innspruck,
who,&mdash;who were very much preferable to the Greenes.&nbsp; As
events turned out, I did meet them.&nbsp; Had I failed in this,
the present Mrs. Robinson would not have been sitting opposite to
me.</p>
<p>I went to my room and dressed myself, and then Sophonisba
presided over the tea-table for me.&nbsp; &ldquo;What are we to
do?&rdquo; she asked me in a confidential whisper.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wait for money from England.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;But they will think we are all sharpers,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;and upon my word I do not wonder at it from the way
in which that woman goes on.&rdquo;&nbsp; She then leaned
forward, resting her elbow on the table and her face on her hand,
and told me a long history of all their family discomforts.&nbsp;
Her papa was a very good sort of man, only he had been made a
fool of by that intriguing woman, who had been left without a
sixpence with which to bless herself.&nbsp; And now they had
nothing but quarrels and misery.&nbsp; Papa did not always got
the worst of it;&mdash;papa could rouse himself sometimes; only
now he was beaten down and cowed by the loss of his money.&nbsp;
This whispering confidence was very nice in its way, seeing that
Sophonisba was a pretty girl; but the whole matter seemed to be
full of suspicion.</p>
<p>&ldquo;If they did not want to take you in in one way, they
did in another,&rdquo; said the present Mrs. Robinson, when I
told the story to her at Innspruck.&nbsp; I beg that it may be
understood that at the time of my meeting the Greenes I was not
engaged to the present Mrs. Robinson, and was open to make any
matrimonial engagement that might have been pleasing to me.</p>
<p>On the next morning, after breakfast, we held a council of
war.&nbsp; I had been informed that Mr. Greene had made a
fortune, and was justified in presuming him to be a rich
man.&nbsp; It seemed to me, therefore, that his course was
easy.&nbsp; Let him wait at Bellaggio for more money, and when he
returned home, let him buy Mrs. Greene more jewels.&nbsp; A poor
man always presumes that a rich man is indifferent about his
money.&nbsp; But in truth a rich man never is indifferent about
his money, and poor Greene looked very blank at my
proposition.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you mean to say that it&rsquo;s gone for
ever?&rdquo; he asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll not leave the country without knowing more
about it,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly is very odd,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp;
Even Sophonisba seemed to think that I was too off-hand.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It will be a month before I can get money, and my bill
here will be something tremendous,&rdquo; said Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t pay them a farthing till I got my
box,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s nonsense,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp;
And so it was.&nbsp; &ldquo;Hold your tongue, Miss!&rdquo; said
the step-mother.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Indeed, I shall not hold my tongue,&rdquo; said the
step-daughter.&nbsp; Poor Greene!&nbsp; He had lost more than his
box within the last twelve months; for, as I had learned in that
whispered conversation over the tea-table with Sophonisba; this
was in reality her papa&rsquo;s marriage trip.</p>
<p>Another day was now gone, and we all went to bed.&nbsp; Had I
not been very foolish I should have had myself called at five in
the morning, and have gone away by the early boat, leaving my ten
napoleons behind me.&nbsp; But, unfortunately, Sophonisba had
exacted a promise from me that I would not do this, and thus all
chance of spending a day or two in Venice was lost to me.&nbsp;
Moreover, I was thoroughly fatigued, and almost glad of any
excuse which would allow me to lie in bed on the following
morning.&nbsp; I did lie in bed till nine o&rsquo;clock, and then
found the Greenes at breakfast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Let us go and look at the Serbelloni Gardens,&rdquo;
said I, as soon as the silent meal was over; &ldquo;or take a
boat over to the Sommariva Villa.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I should like it so much,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will do nothing of the kind till I have found my
property,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Robinson,
what arrangement did you make yesterday with the police at
Como?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The police at Como?&rdquo; I said.&nbsp; &ldquo;I did
not go to the police.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not go to the police?&nbsp; And do you mean to say that
I am to be robbed of my jewels and no efforts made for
redress?&nbsp; Is there no such thing as a constable in this
wretched country?&nbsp; Mr. Greene, I do insist upon it that you
at once go to the nearest British consul.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose I had better write home for money,&rdquo;
said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And do you mean to say that you haven&rsquo;t written
yet?&rdquo; said I, probably with some acrimony in my voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You needn&rsquo;t scold papa,&rdquo; said
Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I am to do,&rdquo; said Mr.
Greene, and he began walking up and down the room; but still he
did not call for pen and ink, and I began again to feel that he
was a swindler.&nbsp; Was it possible that a man of business, who
had made his fortune in London, should allow his wife to keep all
her jewels in a box, and carry about his own money in the
same?</p>
<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see why you need be so very unhappy,
papa,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Robinson,
I&rsquo;m sure, will let you have whatever money you may want at
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was pleasant!</p>
<p>&ldquo;And will Mr. Robinson return me my jewels which were
lost, I must say, in a great measure, through his
carelessness,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.&nbsp; This was
pleasanter!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Upon my word, Mrs. Greene, I must deny that,&rdquo;
said I, jumping up.&nbsp; &ldquo;What on earth could I have done
more than I did do?&nbsp; I have been to Milan and nearly fagged
myself to death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you bring a policeman back with
you?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;You would tell everybody on board the boat what there
was in it,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I told nobody but you,&rdquo; she answered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I suppose you mean to imply that I&rsquo;ve taken the
box,&rdquo; I rejoined.&nbsp; So that on this, the third or
fourth day of our acquaintance, we did not go on together quite
pleasantly.</p>
<p>But what annoyed me, perhaps, the most, was the confidence
with which it seemed to be Mr. Greene&rsquo;s intention to lean
upon my resources.&nbsp; He certainly had not written home yet,
and had taken my ten napoleons, as one friend may take a few
shillings from another when he finds that he has left his own
silver on his dressing-table.&nbsp; What could he have wanted of
ten napoleons?&nbsp; He had alleged the necessity of paying the
porters, but the few francs he had had in his pocket would have
been enough for that.&nbsp; And now Sophonisba was ever and again
prompt in her assurances that he need not annoy himself about
money, because I was at his right hand.&nbsp; I went upstairs
into my own room, and counting all my treasures, found that
thirty-six pounds and some odd silver was the extent of my
wealth.&nbsp; With that I had to go, at any rate, as far as
Innspruck, and from thence back to London.&nbsp; It was quite
impossible that I should make myself responsible for the
Greenes&rsquo; bill at Bellaggio.</p>
<p>We dined early, and after dinner, according to a promise made
in the morning, Sophonisba ascended with me into the Serbelloni
Gardens, and walked round the terraces on that beautiful hill
which commands the view of the three lakes.&nbsp; When we started
I confess that I would sooner have gone alone, for I was sick of
the Greenes in my very soul.&nbsp; We had had a terrible
day.&nbsp; The landlord had been sent for so often, that he
refused to show himself again.&nbsp; The landlady&mdash;though
Italians of that class are always courteous&mdash;had been so
driven that she snapped her fingers in Mrs. Greene&rsquo;s
face.&nbsp; The three girls would not show themselves.&nbsp; The
waiters kept out of the way as much as possible; and the Boots,
in confidence, abused them to me behind their back.&nbsp;
&ldquo;Monsieur,&rdquo; said the Boots, &ldquo;do you think there
ever was such a box?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said I; and yet I knew that I had
seen it.</p>
<p>I would, therefore, have preferred to walk without Sophonisba;
but that now was impossible.&nbsp; So I determined that I would
utilise the occasion by telling her of my present purpose.&nbsp;
I had resolved to start on the following day, and it was now
necessary to make my friends understand that it was not in my
power to extend to them any further pecuniary assistance.</p>
<p>Sophonisba, when we were on the hill, seemed to have forgotten
the box, and to be willing that I should forget it also.&nbsp;
But this was impossible.&nbsp; When, therefore, she told me how
sweet it was to escape from that terrible woman, and leaned on my
arm with all the freedom of old acquaintance, I was obliged to
cut short the pleasure of the moment.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I hope your father has written that letter,&rdquo; said
I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;He means to write it from Milan.&nbsp; We know you want
to get on, so we purpose to leave here the day after
to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said I thinking of the bill immediately, and
remembering that Mrs. Greene had insisted on having champagne for
dinner.</p>
<p>&ldquo;And if anything more is to be done about the nasty box,
it may be done there,&rdquo; continued Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But I must go to-morrow,&rdquo; said I, &ldquo;at 5
a.m.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Nonsense,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp; &ldquo;Go
to-morrow, when I,&mdash;I mean we,&mdash;are going on the next
day!&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;And I might as well explain,&rdquo; said I, gently
dropping the hand that was on my arm, &ldquo;that I find,&mdash;I
find it will be impossible for
me&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To what?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;To advance Mr. Greene any more money just at
present.&rdquo;&nbsp; Then Sophonisba&rsquo;s arm dropped all at
once, and she exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Robinson!&rdquo;</p>
<p>After all, there was a certain hard good sense about Miss
Greene which would have protected her from my evil thoughts had I
known all the truth.&nbsp; I found out afterwards that she was a
considerable heiress, and, in spite of the opinion expressed by
the present Mrs. Robinson when Miss Walker, I do not for a moment
think she would have accepted me had I offered to her.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You are quite right not to embarrass yourself,&rdquo;
she said, when I explained to her my immediate circumstances;
&ldquo;but why did you make papa an offer which you cannot
perform?&nbsp; He must remain here now till he hears from
England.&nbsp; Had you explained it all at first, the ten
napoleons would have carried us to Milan.&rdquo;&nbsp; This was
all true, and yet I thought it hard upon me.</p>
<p>It was evident to me now, that Sophonisba was prepared to join
her step-mother in thinking that I had ill-treated them, and I
had not much doubt that I should find Mr. Greene to be of the
same opinion.&nbsp; There was very little more said between us
during the walk, and when we reached the hotel at seven or
half-past seven o&rsquo;clock, I merely remarked that I would go
in and wish her father and mother good-bye.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
suppose you will drink tea with us,&rdquo; said Sophonisba, and
to this I assented.</p>
<p>I went into my own room, and put all my things into my
portmanteau, for according to the custom, which is invariable in
Italy when an early start is premeditated, the Boots was
imperative in his demand that the luggage should be ready over
night.&nbsp; I then went to the Greene&rsquo;s sitting-room, and
found that the whole party was now aware of my intentions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you are going to desert us,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must go on upon my journey,&rdquo; I pleaded in a
weak apologetic voice.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Go on upon your journey, sir!&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene.&nbsp; &ldquo;I would not for a moment have you put
yourself to inconvenience on our account.&rdquo;&nbsp; And yet I
had already lost fourteen napoleons, and given up all prospect of
going to Venice!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mr. Robinson is certainly right not to break his
engagement with Miss Walker,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.&nbsp; Now I
had said not a word about an engagement with Miss Walker, having
only mentioned incidentally that she would be one of the party at
Innspruck.&nbsp; &ldquo;But,&rdquo; continued she, &ldquo;I think
he should not have misled us.&rdquo;&nbsp; And in this way we
enjoyed our evening meal.</p>
<p>I was just about to shake hands with them all, previous to my
final departure from their presence, when the Boots came into the
room.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll leave the portmanteau till to-morrow
morning,&rdquo; said he.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;there will be such a
crowd of things in the hall.&nbsp; The big trunk I will take away
now.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Big trunk,&mdash;what big trunk?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The trunk with your rug over it, on which your
portmanteau stood.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I looked round at Mr., Mrs., and Miss Greene, and saw that
they were all looking at me.&nbsp; I looked round at them, and as
their eyes met mine I felt that I turned as red as fire.&nbsp; I
immediately jumped up and rushed away to my own room, hearing as
I went that all their steps were following me.&nbsp; I rushed to
the inner recess, pulled down the portmanteau, which still
remained in its old place, tore away my own carpet rug which
covered the support beneath it, and there saw&mdash;a white
canvas-covered box, with a hole in the canvas on the side next to
me!</p>
<p>&ldquo;It is my box,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene, pushing me away,
as she hurried up and put her finger within the rent.</p>
<p>&ldquo;It certainly does look like it,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene,
peering over his wife&rsquo;s shoulder.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no doubt about the box,&rdquo; said
Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not the least in life,&rdquo; said I, trying to assume
an indifferent look.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; said the Boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corpo di Baccho!&rdquo; exclaimed the landlord, who had
now joined the party.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;h&mdash;!&rdquo; screamed Mrs.
Greene, and then she threw herself back on to my bed, and
shrieked hysterically.</p>
<p>There was no doubt whatsoever about the fact.&nbsp; There was
the lost box, and there it had been during all those tedious
hours of unavailing search.&nbsp; While I was suffering all that
fatigue in Milan, spending my precious zwanzigers in driving
about from one hotel to another, the box had been safe, standing
in my own room at Bellaggio, hidden by my own rug.&nbsp; And now
that it was found everybody looked at me as though it were all my
fault.</p>
<p>Mrs. Greene&rsquo;s eyes, when she had done being hysterical,
were terrible, and Sophonisba looked at me as though I were a
convicted thief.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who put the box here?&rdquo; I said, turning fiercely
upon the Boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I did,&rdquo; said the Boots, &ldquo;by
Monsieur&rsquo;s express order.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;By my order?&rdquo; I exclaimed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; said the Boots.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Corpo di Baccho!&rdquo; said the landlord, and he also
looked at me as though I were a thief.&nbsp; In the mean time the
landlady and the three daughters had clustered round Mrs. Greene,
administering to her all manner of Italian consolation.&nbsp; The
box, and the money, and the jewels were after all a reality; and
much incivility can be forgiven to a lady who has really lost her
jewels, and has really found them again.</p>
<p>There and then there arose a hurly-burly among us as to the
manner in which the odious trunk found its way into my
room.&nbsp; Had anybody been just enough to consider the matter
coolly, it must have been quite clear that I could not have
ordered it there.&nbsp; When I entered the hotel, the boxes were
already being lugged about, and I had spoken a word to no one
concerning them.&nbsp; That traitorous Boots had done
it,&mdash;no doubt without malice prepense; but he had done it;
and now that the Greenes were once more known as moneyed people,
he turned upon me, and told me to my face, that I had desired
that box to be taken to my own room as part of my own
luggage!</p>
<p>&ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene, turning to his wife,
&ldquo;you should never mention the contents of your luggage to
any one.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I never will again,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene, with a
mock repentant air, &ldquo;but I really thought&mdash;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;One never can be sure of sharpers,&rdquo; said Mr.
Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;After all, it may have been accidental,&rdquo; said
Sophonisba, on hearing which good-natured surmise both papa and
mamma Greene shook their suspicious heads.</p>
<p>I was resolved to say nothing then.&nbsp; It was all but
impossible that they should really think that I had intended to
steal their box; nor, if they did think so, would it have become
me to vindicate myself before the landlord and all his
servants.&nbsp; I stood by therefore in silence, while two of the
men raised the trunk, and joined the procession which followed it
as it was carried out of my room into that of the legitimate
owner.&nbsp; Everybody in the house was there by that time, and
Mrs. Greene, enjoying the triumph, by no means grudged them the
entrance into her sitting-room.&nbsp; She had felt that she was
suspected, and now she was determined that the world of Bellaggio
should know how much she was above suspicion.&nbsp; The box was
put down upon two chairs, the supporters who had borne it
retiring a pace each.&nbsp; Mrs. Greene then advanced proudly
with the selected key, and Mr. Greene stood by at her right
shoulder, ready to receive his portion of the hidden
treasure.&nbsp; Sophonisba was now indifferent, and threw herself
on the sofa, while I walked up and down the room
thoughtfully,&mdash;meditating what words I should say when I
took my last farewell of the Greenes.&nbsp; But as I walked I
could see what occurred.&nbsp; Mrs. Greene opened the box, and
displayed to view the ample folds of a huge yellow woollen
dressing-down.&nbsp; I could fancy that she would not willingly
have exhibited this article of her toilet, had she not felt that
its existence would speedily be merged in the presence of the
glories which were to follow.&nbsp; This had merely been the
padding at the top of the box.&nbsp; Under that lay a long
papier-mach&eacute; case, and in that were all her
treasures.&nbsp; &ldquo;Ah, they are safe,&rdquo; she said,
opening the lid and looking upon her tawdry pearls and
carbuncles.</p>
<p>Mr. Greene, in the mean time, well knowing the passage for his
hand, had dived down to the very bottom of the box, and seized
hold of a small canvas bag.&nbsp; &ldquo;It is here,&rdquo; said
he, dragging it up, &ldquo;and as far as I can tell, as yet, the
knot has not been untied.&rdquo;&nbsp; Whereupon he sat himself
down by Sophonisba, and employing her to assist him in holding
them, began to count his rolls.&nbsp; &ldquo;They are all
right,&rdquo; said he; and he wiped the perspiration from his
brow.</p>
<p>I had not yet made up my mind in what manner I might best
utter my last words among them so as to maintain the dignity of
my character, and now I was standing over against Mr. Greene with
my arms folded on my breast.&nbsp; I had on my face a frown of
displeasure, which I am able to assume upon occasions, but I had
not yet determined what words I would use.&nbsp; After all,
perhaps, it might be as well that I should leave them without any
last words.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Greene, my dear,&rdquo; said the lady, &ldquo;pay the
gentleman his ten napoleons.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh yes, certainly;&rdquo; whereupon Mr. Greene undid
one of the rolls and extracted eight sovereigns.&nbsp; &ldquo;I
believe that will make it right, sir,&rdquo; said he, handing
them to me.</p>
<p>I took the gold, slipped it with an indifferent air into my
waistcoat pocket, and then refolded my arms across my breast.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Papa,&rdquo; said Sophonisba, in a very audible
whisper, &ldquo;Mr. Robinson went for you to Como.&nbsp; Indeed,
I believe he says he went to Milan.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do not let that be mentioned,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;By all means pay him his expenses,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene; &ldquo;I would not owe him anything for
worlds.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;He should be paid,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, certainly,&rdquo; said Mr. Greene.&nbsp; And he at
once extracted another sovereign, and tendered it to me in the
face of the assembled multitude.</p>
<p>This was too much!&nbsp; &ldquo;Mr. Greene,&rdquo; said I,
&ldquo;I intended to be of service to you when I went to Milan,
and you are very welcome to the benefit of my intentions.&nbsp;
The expense of that journey, whatever may be its amount, is my
own affair.&rdquo;&nbsp; And I remained standing with my closed
arms.</p>
<p>&ldquo;We will be under no obligation to him,&rdquo; said Mrs.
Greene; &ldquo;and I shall insist on his taking the
money.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The servant will put it on his dressing-table,&rdquo;
said Sophonisba.&nbsp; And she handed the sovereign to the Boots,
giving him instructions.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Keep it yourself, Antonio,&rdquo; I said.&nbsp;
Whereupon the man chucked it to the ceiling with his thumb,
caught it as it fell, and with a well-satisfied air, dropped it
into the recesses of his pocket.&nbsp; The air of the Greenes was
also well satisfied, for they felt that they had paid me in full
for all my services.</p>
<p>And now, with many obsequious bows and assurances of deep
respect, the landlord and his family withdrew from the
room.&nbsp; &ldquo;Was there anything else they could do for Mrs.
Greene?&rdquo;&nbsp; Mrs. Greene was all affability.&nbsp; She
had shown her jewels to the girls, and allowed them to express
their admiration in pretty Italian superlatives.&nbsp; There was
nothing else she wanted to-night.&nbsp; She was very happy and
liked Bellaggio.&nbsp; She would stay yet a week, and would make
herself quite happy.&nbsp; And, though none of them understood a
word that the other said, each understood that things were now
rose-coloured, and so with scrapings, bows, and grinning smiles,
the landlord and all his myrmidons withdrew.&nbsp; Mr. Greene was
still counting his money, sovereign by sovereign, and I was still
standing with my folded arms upon my bosom.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I believe I may now go,&rdquo; said I.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Greene.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Adieu,&rdquo; said Sophonisba.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I have the pleasure of wishing you good-bye,&rdquo;
said Mr. Greene.</p>
<p>And then I walked out of the room.&nbsp; After all, what was
the use of saying anything?&nbsp; And what could I say that would
have done me any service?&nbsp; If they were capable of thinking
me a thief,&mdash;which they certainly did,&mdash;nothing that I
could say would remove the impression.&nbsp; Nor, as I thought,
was it suitable that I should defend myself from such an
imputation.&nbsp; What were the Greenes to me?&nbsp; So I walked
slowly out of the room, and never again saw one of the family
from that day to this.</p>
<p>As I stood upon the beach the next morning, while my
portmanteau was being handed into the boat, I gave the Boots five
zwanzigers.&nbsp; I was determined to show him that I did not
condescend to feel anger against him.</p>
<p>He took the money, looked into my face, and then whispered to
me, &ldquo;Why did you not give me a word of notice
beforehand?&rdquo; he said, and winked his eye.&nbsp; He was
evidently a thief, and took me to be another;&mdash;but what did
it matter?</p>
<p>I went thence to Milan, in which city I had no heart to look
at anything; thence to Verona, and so over the pass of the
Brenner to Innspruck.&nbsp; When I once found myself near to my
dear friends the Walkers I was again a happy man; and I may
safely declare that, though a portion of my journey was so
troublesome and unfortunate, I look back upon that tour as the
happiest and the luckiest epoch of my life.</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
