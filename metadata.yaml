description: As I was not myself possessed of anything of that sort, and had no intention
  of going to any foreign court, I could not argue the matter with her. But I assisted
  her in getting together an enormous pile of luggage, among which there were seven
  large boxes covered with canvas, such as ladies not uncommonly carry with them when
  travelling. That one which she represented as being smaller than the others, and
  as holding jewellery, might be about a yard long by a foot and a half deep.
